Abstracts & the submission process
Customization of the submission form
Starting from a default, standard submission form, modify it to suit your workflow.
Add any number of user-defined fields to the form (check boxes, radio buttons, text boxes, drop down lists).
Add instructions texts, images and insert links to reference documents on or around the form.
Style and format the abstracts.
File uploads
Extended abstracts
Extended abstracts can be collected together with the abstract, in one step.
Full papers / camera-ready versions
Full papers are collected independently of the abstract, typically after the review process.
Presentations
Gather the speakers' presentation slides and material ahead of the conference.
Options for the submission process
Editor
Choose between a rich editor or a simple text editor for the texts on the submission form (abstract title, abstract text and other text boxes).
Images
Decide whether to allow the insertion of pictures into the text of the abstract. Fine tune related options (maximum number of allowed pictures; maximum size, in KB, of a picture; type of allowed images).
Mathematical and chemical equations
Decide whether to allow the insertion of equations and formulae into the abstract. We use MathJax to handle mathematical equations and mhchem to handle chemical formulae and equations.
Number of allowed submissions
If required, set a limit on the number of submissions allowed on each account.
Presenting authors
As an option, require that speakers have an account with the system. If payments are collected for conference attendance, you will then be able to check that the speakers have paid their attendance fee before finalising the conference programme.
Tracks & Topics
Choose between a one-level classification of the topics or a two-level classification into tracks and then topics within the tracks.
Allow the submitters of abstracts to indicate a second and third choice for the topics (and tracks, if applicable).
Preferred type of presentation
Allow the submitters of abstracts to indicate a second and third choice for their preferred type of presentation.
Keywords

Access control and handling of deadlines

Set the availability times that fit your time zone.
Export of the abstracts
Submitters can export their submission to HTML or PDF, to check its styling and formatting.
Administrators can export all submissions, or any subset of the submissions, to HTML, CSV, Excel, MS-Word and PDF.
Handling of size limitations, format restrictions
Set size limits on file uploads (extended abstracts, full papers, presentations) and pictures; control the allowed file extensions.

Why CoMaSo?
Good software evolves iteratively in response to users' feedback. We have been listening to our users and adapting our software.
A design that is simple and solid
Conference participants are scattered around the world, using different bandwidths, computers and browsers. We design our software to minimise the load put on a user's device, to ensure that most conference participants can use our tool without strain.
A tool that is powerful and flexible
Each event is different and requires a different workflow. We design our software to cover as many options as needed while keeping it as simple and unclutttered as possible.
Providing numerous auxiliary functions
Although organisers seek software to manage the essential conference functions, like abstracts and payments, they often also need auxiliary functions, like certificates of participation, custom forms, the collection of personal documents from the participants, a check-in module and more. These functions are provided at no additional cost.
Keeping everything in one place
Many of the functions needed to manage an event are included in our tools, allowing a tight integration between different modules. For example, organisers can monitor the payment status of the speakers when selecting submissions and automatically register a selected group of participants to our virtual platform. Organisers can also import external user data via Excel uploads.
A well-structured navigation
Event organisers need to access a large number of different functions in order to manage the event throughout its life cycle. Our navigation layout is designed to minimise the load on the users' memory, through an intuitive partitioning of the tasks at hand and by being always open (directly accessible) on wide screens.
Language integration
We maintain the user interface of our software in three languages: English, French and German. Organisers can use any combination of these languages for their event. We also provide a translation module that can make use of machine translations as well as human translations. This allows any left to right language to be used in addition to or instead of the three core languages.
Providing strong support
Complex software requires good documentation and meaningful support. We address all queries by analyzing them in context and tailoring our answers to the problem at hand.
